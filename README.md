# Memory Card Game
As part of the Odin Project's curriculum, I created a Memory Card Game using React. The main challenge in this project was fetching the images using an API. I did this with useEffect and the Discogs API. I also made sure to cache my images using localStorage so that the API would be called fewer times.
